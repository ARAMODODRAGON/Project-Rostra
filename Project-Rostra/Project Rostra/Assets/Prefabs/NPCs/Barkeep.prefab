    sentences:
    - What'll be folks? Ocrestian Ale?
    - We....
    - No no no, of course not! You search something finer! Lysian Red, produced in
      the Silver Sands region. A personal favourite a mine and several of me customers.
    - No we just need...
    - Something better! Gotrun's famous Bootkicker pint! One sip and you'll be gone
      for hours!
    - I need to know where Domel is. Do you know where he might be?
    - The dwarf? Haven't seen him in days. Though don't go mentioning his name so
      loudly.
    - Why not?
    - 'Our village finds itself in a right bit of trouble. The Alchemy Guild and it''s
      dwarven workers are in a dispute right now. Domel rests at the center of this. '
    - What does he have to do with it?
    - I... I've got other patrons to serve.
    - I can assure you we all tip well.
    - Tell us more about Domel.
    - 'Well the dispute arose because the dwarven workers feel their labour is being
      exploited. The Alchemy Guild feels they treat their workers better than most
      guilds do. '
    - A little bit of work is needed to ensure they can continue to make the elixirs
      we need and are hellbent creating the elixir of immortality.
    - 'Or so they say. Domels the only one who was willing to talk to both sides and
      worked tirelessly to ensure that conflict would never become a war. '
    - Bless him, he always puts the good of the people before his own. However both
      sides have been blaming Domels disappearance on each other.
    - ' It''s become a pretty sore subject. People are starting to worry for his safety. '
    - I am too.
    - Where was he last seen?
    - I don't know. But I do know who might. Both the alchemy guild and the Dwarves
      knew him very well it's possible they would know or would atleast point you
      in the right direction.
    - Alright, we can go talk to them and find out where Domel went.
    - If the Alchemy Guild members or The Dwarves see you talking to the other side
      they'll get suspicious and won't give you the info you're looking for. If I
      was you I'd only pick one.
    - Which do you consider to be the most trustworthy?
    - 'Don''t reckon I know. Been keeping outta troubles in the hopes that this whole
      thing will blow over. I will say this. '
    - The Alchemy Guild always has some idea what's happening in this village.
    - 'The Dwarves have a lot of personal connections and knew Domel personally. '
    - 'One more piece of advice. Don''t completly trust either. '
    - I get the sense that they are both trying to gain the upper hand in this situation.
