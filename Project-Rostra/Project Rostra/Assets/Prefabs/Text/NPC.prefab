    sentences:
    - What'll be folks? Ocrestian Ale?
    - We....
    - No no no, of course not! You search something finer! Lysian Red, produced in
      the Silver Sands region. A personal favourite a mine and several of me customers.
    - No we just need...
    - Something better! Gotrun's famous Bootkicker pint! One sip and you'll be gone
      for hours!
    - I need to know where Domel is. Do you know where he might be?
    - The dwarf? Haven't seen him in days. Though don't go mentioning his name so
      loudly.
    - Why not?
    - 'Our village finds itself in a right bit of trouble. The Alchemy Guild and it''s
      dwarven workers are in a dispute right now. Domel rests at the center of this. '
    - What does he have to do with it?
    - I... I've got other patrons to serve.
    - I can assure you we all tip well.
    - Tell us more about Domel.
    - 'Well the dispute arose because the dwarven workers feel their labour is being
      exploited. The Alchemy Guild feels they treat their workers better than most
      guilds do. '
    - A little bit of work is needed to ensure they can continue to make the elixirs
      we need and are hellbent creating the elixir of immortality.
    - 'Or so they say. Domels the only one who was willing to talk to both sides and
      worked tirelessly to ensure that conflict would never become a war. '
    - Bless him, he always puts the good of the people before his own. However both
      sides have been blaming Domels disappearance on each other.
    - ' It''s become a pretty sore subject. People are starting to worry for his safety. '
    - I am too.
    - Where was he last seen?
    - I don't know. But I do know who might. Both the alchemy guild and the Dwarves
      knew him very well it's possible they would know or would atleast point you
      in the right direction.
    - Alright, we can go talk to them and find out where Domel went.
    - If the Alchemy Guild members or The Dwarves see you talking to the other side
      they'll get suspicious and won't give you the info you're looking for. If I
      was you I'd only pick one.
    - Which do you consider to be the most trustworthy?
    - 'Don''t reckon I know. Been keeping outta troubles in the hopes that this whole
      thing will blow over. I will say this. '
    - The Alchemy Guild always has some idea what's happening in this village.
    - 'The Dwarves have a lot of personal connections and knew Domel personally. '
    - 'One more piece of advice. Don''t completly trust either. '
    - I get the sense that they are both trying to gain the upper hand in this situation.

    - Now then, why do you seek Domel? Are you in league with that tretcherous Guild?
    - No we come here on our own will. Domel is a good friend of ours. We want to
      try and find him. We were told you could lead us to him.
    - Strange, he didn't mention you in the mines.
    - We aren't from around here. We come from Udrasil.
    - 'The capital? Heh. Outsiders. Alright I''m willing to help you but I can''t
      give much info. '
    - All we know is the last place he was seen was near his home in the Outskirts
      of town. We tried to go ourselves to see him but there are too many monsters.
      I don't want another of my kin to go missing.
    - Besides, It's clear the Alchemy Guild assissinated him so they could sow discord
      and wipe us out.
    - We've all accepted the risks of going. Do you have any more information?
    - 'This is where we will end it off to avoid spoilers. Go to the door of the tavern
      to continue the story. '

    - Alarise
    - My name is Terrel, at your service!
    - My name is Arc.... I mean Ariane.
    - Good. Now if I might ask why do you seek Domel?
    - He was a good friend of ours. We are from Udrasil. We wanted to stop by and
      say hello but he is no where to be found.
    - He has been missing a few days now. He lives on the outskirts of town. We sent
      out a search party but the monsters were too many. We could not reach his home.
    - I'm sure he was murdered by one of the other Dwarves looking to remove our only
      way of communicating with them. I do not want you to go looking for him and
      fall victim to those monsters.
    - We all want to do every thing we can to help him. Do you know where we can look?
    - 'This is where we will end it off to avoid spoilers. Go to the door of the tavern
      to continue the story. '
