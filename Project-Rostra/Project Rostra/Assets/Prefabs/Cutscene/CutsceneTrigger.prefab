      sentences:
      - Hey hey, how's my old stick in the mud doing? How can I be of service?
      - 'Oberon. A high born Aszartian lute player turned spearman for the Ocrestian
        Army. '
      - It's about Brenna I haven't been receiving letters from her recently.
      - I wouldn't worry too much. Maybe she just hasn't had the time to write back?
      - Her husband died recently and she wanted to see me. Does that sound like a
        reason for her to stop writing.
      - Hmmmmm that does sound strange.
      - Look... I want to go see her. I've talked to the commanders but they've all
        forbidden me to go.
      - Can I trust your silence if I were to go?
      - I'll do you one better. I'll come with you.
      - I could never put your life in danger like that.
      - Listen, when you found me in Udrasil I was a spoiled brat who got whatever
        he wanted at the drop of a hat.
      - I wasted my life in the taverns. Until you came and talked some sense to me.
      - I've made something of myself and I'd be honored to fight at your side.
      - Besides how could you turn down having the greatest spearman in all Ocrest?
      - Oberon... I... thank you.
      - What kind of friend would I be if I were to leave you when you needed me most?
        Now come on stop being so dramatic.
